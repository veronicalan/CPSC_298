Creating this Recipe FInder app on V0 was a very interesting and educational process. When creating the app through V0 it is crucial to be specific to the needs and wants of the app including UI and program execution. The images attached show the overall layout of the app with custom colors, fonts, and icons selected. The images also portray the functionality of the app. V0 was able to quickly and efficiently create a usable app to navigate in, however, issues with functionality often occur such as the inability to search within the search bar or the issue of showing all recipes listed, as shown in one of the attached images. Overall, I really enjoyed using V0 as it allows efficient development of programs and encourages creativity.<img width="735" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-17 at 9 25 43 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf9dd6c1-e28b-4b4e-a9ce-f2367839f786">
